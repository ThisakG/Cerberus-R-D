        <h1>CERBERUS RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT</h1><br>
        <p>At Cerberus Research Labs, we pride ourselves on pushing the boundaries of cybersecurity innovation. 
            Our state-of-the-art research designed to support next-generation testing, 
            secure data exchange, and advanced threat simulations. 
            As part of our team, analysts and penetration testers are tasked with uncovering vulnerabilities 
            before adversaries do.</p>
            
        <p>Cerberus stands as the three-headed guardian at the gates of modern digital infrastructure; 
            vigilant, relentless, and unyielding in the face of cyber threats. 
            From secure communications to classified research, our mission is clear: defend what others cannot.</p>
        
        <br>

        <center><p><b>Beyond the Firewall</b></p></center>
        
        <p>At Cerberus, we don’t just patch holes—we stare into the void where malware lurks, and sometimes it blinks first. 
            Our systems are so secure that even ghosts of hackers past have been known to retire early.</p>  

        <center><p><b>Innovation with Bite</b></p></center>
           
        <p>Every line of code we write, every exploit we simulate, 
            and every red-team exercise is guided by the three heads of Cerberus:</p>

        <p>The Analyst Head: Sees every log, every packet, and every suspicious blinking LED.</p>

        <p>The Hacker Head: Thinks like an adversary so you don’t have to… unless you want to, then that’s fine too.</p>

        <p>The Coffee Head: Keeps the other two functioning at peak mythical efficiency.</p>

        <br>

        <center><p><b>Myth Meets Machine</b></p></center>

        <p>Why settle for ordinary cybersecurity when you can have a three-headed guardian? 
            Cerberus R&D fuses classical mythology with modern tech: AI algorithms that bark, 
            IDS systems that snarl, and firewalls that actually breathe fire (metaphorically… mostly).</p>

        <br>

        <center><p><b>Classified Fun</b></p></center>

        <p>Sometimes our experiments get a little… unusual. 
            We’ve tested everything from encrypted teleportation packets to malware that politely asks for permission 
            before running. Rumor has it, a few interns are still hiding in the lab’s digital labyrinth.</p>

        <br>

        <center><p><b>Join the Hunt</b></p></center>

        <p>At Cerberus, we don’t just defend the gates—we redesign them, trap intruders in infinite loops, 
            and occasionally leave a digital bone or two for curious adventurers. 
            Fancy joining the hunt? Make sure your armor is patched, your passwords are strong, 
            and your sense of humor is as sharp as our intrusion detection system.</p>
